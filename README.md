# python-pwd-checker

welcome,

a simple but effective pwd checker with the help of 'amibeeingpwned' :)

version: 1.0
- works per terminal
- >> python3 <NAME_OF_PRGRAMM.PY> <first_PW> <SECOND_PW_IF_NEEDED> <AND_SO_FORTH>

next version will be more user friendly
meaning: working with user-prompts and sys.argv[]
